# Fullstack Authentication Example with Next.js and NextAuth.js


- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (frontend)
- [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)
- [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client) (backend).
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication. 
- [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org/) as the database of choice.

Before you deploy the application, ensure you
- Create a separate GitHub OAuth application before you deploy your application
- Update the **Authorization callback URL** with the URL of the deployed app after successfully deploying the app

Note that the app uses a mix of server-side rendering with `getServerSideProps` (SSR) and static site generation with `getStaticProps` (SSG). When possible, SSG is used to make database queries already at build-time (e.g. when fetching the [public feed](./pages/index.tsx)). Sometimes, the user requesting data needs to be authenticated, so SSR is being used to render data dynamically on the server-side (e.g. when viewing a user's [drafts](./pages/drafts.tsx)).

## Getting started

### 1. Download and install dependencies

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-nextjs-blog.git
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-nextjs-blog
npm install
```

</details>

### 2. Create and seed the database

If you're using Docker on your computer, the following script to set up PostgreSQL database using the `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of your project:

```
npm run db:up
```

Run the following command to create your PostgreSQL database. This also creates the `User`, `Post`, `Account`, `Session` and `VerificationToken` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

When `npx prisma migrate dev` is executed against a newly created database, seeding is also triggered. The seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) will be executed and your database will be populated with the sample data.


### 3. Configuring your authentication provider

In order to get this example to work, you need to configure the [GitHub](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/github) authentication provider from NextAuth.js.

#### Configuring the GitHub authentication provider

<details><summary>Expand to learn how you can configure the GitHub authentication provider</summary>

First, log into your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

Then, navigate to [**Settings**](https://github.com/settings/profile), then open to [**Developer Settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps), then switch to [**OAuth Apps**](https://github.com/settings/developers).

Clicking on the **Register a new application** button will redirect you to a registration form to fill out some information for your app. The **Authorization callback URL** should be the Next.js `/api/auth` route.

An important thing to note here is that the **Authorization callback URL** field only supports a single URL, unlike e.g. Auth0, which allows you to add additional callback URLs separated with a comma. This means if you want to deploy your app later with a production URL, you will need to set up a new GitHub OAuth app.

Click on the **Register application** button, and then you will be able to find your newly generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy and paste this info into the [`.env`](./env) file in the root directory.

The resulting section in the `.env` file might look like this:

```
# GitHub oAuth
GITHUB_ID=6bafeb321963449bdf51
GITHUB_SECRET=509298c32faa283f28679ad6de6f86b2472e1bff
```

</details>


### 4. Start the app

```
npm run dev
```

The app is now running, navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to explore its UI.

## Evolving the app

Evolving the application typically requires three steps:

1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate
1. Update your server-side application code
1. Build new UI features in React

For the following example scenario, assume you want to add a "profile" feature to the app where users can create a profile and write a short bio about themselves.

### 1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate

The first step is to add a new table, e.g. called `Profile`, to the database. You can do this by adding a new model to your [Prisma schema file](./prisma/schema.prisma) file and then running a migration afterwards:

```diff
// schema.prisma

model Post {
  id        Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id      Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id 
  name    String? 
  email   String   @unique
  posts   Post[]
+ profile Profile?
}

+model Profile {
+  id     Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
+  bio    String?
+  userId Int     @unique
+  user   User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
+}
```

Once you've updated your data model, you can execute the changes against your database with the following command:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 2. Update your application code

You can now use your `PrismaClient` instance to perform operations against the new `Profile` table. Here are some examples:

#### Create a new profile for an existing user

```ts
const profile = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: "Hello World",
    user: {
      connect: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Create a new user with a new profile

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: "john@prisma.io",
    name: "John",
    profile: {
      create: {
        bio: "Hello World",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Update the profile of an existing user

```ts
const userWithUpdatedProfile = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
  data: {
    profile: {
      update: {
        bio: "Hello Friends",
      },
    },
  },
});
```


### 3. Build new UI features in React

Once you have added a new endpoint to the API (e.g. `/api/profile` with `/POST`, `/PUT` and `GET` operations), you can start building a new UI component in React. It could e.g. be called `profile.tsx` and would be located in the `pages` directory.

In the application code, you can access the new endpoint via `fetch` operations and populate the UI with the data you receive from the API calls.


## Switch to another database (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB)

If you want to try this example with another database than SQLite, you can adjust the the database connection in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) by reconfiguring the `datasource` block. 

Learn more about the different connection configurations in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls).

<details><summary>Expand for an overview of example configurations with different databases</summary>

### PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=SCHEMA"
}
```

Here is an example connection string with a local PostgreSQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/notesapi?schema=public"
}
```
